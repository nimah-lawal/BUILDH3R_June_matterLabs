# Build smart contract

This educational experience laid a strong foundation in Ethereum smart contract development, deployment, and interaction. Through practical tasks and GitHub updates, I gained hands-on experience and built a demonstrative code portfolio. I acquired skills in creating ERC20 tokens, managing hashed messages on the blockchain, and automating smart contract interactions with ethers.js. Additionally, I explored zkSync and paymasters for transaction fee management and token balance oversight.
